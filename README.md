## Why was IndieRealm created?
Indie video-game developers are generally very underrated due to their medium of work and publishing. However, there are famous examples of a handful of games that were developed by indie-game developers that have gathered immense amount of popularity and love.
IndieRealm is trying to make an impact to the realm of indie video-games by providing independent video game developers and publishers a platform to publish and sell their games on. Due to the nature and trends of video-game industry, IndieRealm was exclusively designed with the indie genre in mind.

## Ending Note

This project was built from the ground up during [Hack4Bengal](https://hack4bengal.tech). Due to the nature of hackathons and time constraint, the Figma design wasn't exactly replicated, but we have tried to replicate it as much as possible, and keep differences to a bare minimum.
